Comiola Tutorial: Projects, Shots, and Cameras
</div>

<p>
Let's start by making a very simple 4-shot movie. First, create an empty 
folder for your project. Then right-click on the image below and save it in
the folder. The file name is "queenofnight.jpg".
<p>
<img src="queenofnight.jpg" width="270" height="248">
</p>

To create the new project, click the File button in the upper left corner
of the editor. The file dropdown pane will appear.
<p>
<img src="filedropdown.jpg">
</p>
Enter a name for your project ("MyProject"), then click New. The Select Folder
dialog appears: select the folder you created earlier. Comiola will create 
a new (empty) project. The display next to the file button changes to
<p>
<img src="projdir.jpg">
</p>
The project file is named "MyProject.cprj" 
(all project files end with ".cprj").
To reopen this project after you've exited and then restarted Comiloa, 
click File/Open and select that file from the File Open dialog.
<p>
To add the first shot, click the "Add Shots" button in the right control 
panel.
<p>
<img src="addshots.jpg">
</p>
In the File Select dialog, go to the project directory and select 
"queenofnight.jpg". The editor displays the first shot. Notice there's
a small green square in the center, surrounded by the much larger green
outline. These represent the camera. Click the small green square: it
turns into a circle, indicating the camera has been selected. A small green
triangle will appear on the right hand side of the outline: that's 
a resize handle.  Click and drag the triangle towards the square,
reducing the size of the enclosing green outline -- 
we're bringing the camera in for a closeup.
Click on the green circle, and drag the camera so it's centered on the
sphinx. Fiddle with the camera controls until you get something like this:
<p>
<img src="sphinx.jpg">
</p>

What's this shot actually look like? Here's a closeup of the right
control panel.
<p>
<img src="play.jpg">
</p>
             
Click the "Play" button. You'll see a 2-second shot of the
sphinx. Not very interesting, so let's add a second shot.
In the editor control panel, click the "Clone Shot" button: 
<p>
<img src="cloneshot.jpg">
</p>
<p>

Nothing seems to have happened, but if you look at the top control panel
you'll see we're now on Shot 2 of 2.
<p>
<img src="shotnav.jpg">
</p>

Tip: if you enter "1" and click GOTO, you'll be taken back to Shot1. You
can also navigate backwards and forwards by clicking the left and right
arrow buttons.

<p>

We're now on the second shot. Move and resize the camera so it looks like
this.

<p>
<img src="driver.jpg">
</p>

Create a third shot by clicking Clone Shot again,
then move the camera down to the birds:

<p>
<img src="birds1.jpg">
</p>

So far we've created a 3-shot sequence. To see what it looks like,
click the Play All button.
<p>
<img src="playall.jpg">
</p>

These shots are all static. Let's make a 
shot which animates the camera. First click the Clone Shot button,
taking us to the next shot. Click the center green square
of the camera: it turns into a circle, indicating its selected.
On the top control bar, click the "Pt: Add" button. 
<p>
<img src="ptadd.jpg">
</p>

<p>
This adds a second point to the camera path, creating an animation. 
Use the move/resize handles of the second point so that the camera 
boxes look something like this:
<p>
<p>
<img src="birds2.jpg">
</p>

<p>
The second camera surrounds the first, so this will be zoom-out.
Click Play to see the effect.
<p>
Let's turn the shot into a zoom-out followed by a pan. Click the
Pt: Add button to add a third point to the animation path, then
use the move/resize handles of the third camera so the whole thing
looks like this.
<p>
<img src="addshots7.jpg">
</p>
Click Play to see how the zoom+pans works. It
might work better if the camera lingered a bit at the
end of the shot, so the viewer can look a bit longer at the
queen's face. In the top control bar, find the boxes labled 
"tS" and "tE" (these mean "time-Start" and "time-End".
Click on any point in the camera animation to
select that animation's path, and note that tS is "0.0" and 
tE is "1.0". 
<p>
<img src="tStE.jpg">
</p>
"tS = 0.0" means: start the animation at the start of the shot.
If we wanted the animation to start when 1/4 of the time
allocated to the shot has passed, we'd set this value to ".25".
In this case we want the animation to start when the shot begins,
so we'll leave tS at 0.0
<p>
"tE = 1.0" means: complete the animation when the shot ends. To 
make the camera linger a bit at the end of the shot, change tE
to ".75". That means: time the animation so that it's complete,
3/4 thru the time allocated to the shot. That will give the effect 
we're after. So change tS to ".75", click Play, and verify
that it all works the way it's supposed to.
<p>
To see what we've accomplished so far, click the Play All button 
in the right control panel. The results are promising but the
rythymn of the shots feels wrong: it would be better if the first
three shot were short and quick, and the animated shot were a
lot longer. To fix this, make sure you're on the 4th shot,
and find the Set Ticks button in the right control panel.
<p>
<img src="setticks.jpg">
</p>
A tick is a unit of time. By default, Comiola assigns each shot 
10 ticks. If you want a shot to last 1/2 as long as the default,
set its ticks to "5". If you want it to last 4 times as long, set its
ticks to "40". 
<p>
But how long is a tick in seconds? That depends! Have a closer look
at the Animation section of the right control panel.
<p>
<img src="animation.jpg">
</p>
Both of the "Play" buttons, plus Create Video, have a "secs" (short for
"seconds") field. When 
you click a play button (or create the video) Comiola will total up 
all the ticks for each shot, then adjust the milliseconds in a tick to
ensure that the duration of the animation accords with the value in
the "secs" field.
<p>
Timing in animation is everything! The best way to get a feel for it is to
play with the settings. If you want to make a shot shorter, assign it 
less ticks. If you want to make it longer, give it more ticks. Then 
experiment with the "secs" values to see how the whole piece flows.
<p> 
To wrap up this tutorial, click Create Video in the right control
panel. 

<p>
<img src="createvideo.jpg">
</p>
If your project is named "MyProject", this will create the file
"MyProject.mp4" in the project directory. Once the video has been
created, Comiola will popup a browser window so you can see it in action.

<p>
The next tutorial builds on this one, so you should save the project.
When you close Comiola by clicking the X in the top right corner,
you'll be asked if you want to save the project: just click yes in
the popup dialog. Or you can click the File button in the top
control panel and click Save on the dropdown menu.

Comiola Tutorial2: Animating Sprites
</div>
<p>

This tutorial uses 4 new images:
<p>
<img src="goose1.png">
<img src="goose2.png">
<img src="goose3.png">
<img src="goose4.png">
<p>
Right-click each of them, and save them to your project directory. Re-open
your project, navigate to the last shot, and click Add Shots. Select 
queenofnight.jpg in the File Select dialog. Leave the camera as is 
(centered and as wide as possible). Click Sprites: Add in the right
control panel:
<p>
<img src="addsprites.jpg">
</p>

and select all four of the goose images in the File Select 
Dialog. This will add a goose to the shot:
<p>
<img src="sprite1.jpg">
</p>

To move a sprite, click and drag the red square in the center
(the square turns into a circle to show it's been selected).
When a sprite is selected, a red triangle appears on the right
side of the enclosing red rectangle:
that's a resize handle. Click and drag the handle to 
resize the sprite.  Use these controls
to move the goose down to the lower left corner of the shot,
and make it bigger. It should look something like this:
<p>
<img src="sprites2.jpg">
</p>
We're going to make the goose fly up and out of the shot, using a
3 point animation path. So far we've got the first point. Make sure
it's selected: if not, click on the small red square in the center
of the sprite to select it (it will turn into a circle to show it's
selected). Add the second
point by clicking Pt: Add on the top control bar.
<p>
<img src="ptadd.jpg">
</p>
Click it again to add the third point. At this point it should look
like this:
<p>
<img src="sprites3.jpg">
</p>

Now move and resize the new
points so the shot looks something like the picture below.
<p>
Tip: to add a point to a path, the path must first have been selected
(otherwise the Pt: Add button is inactive). To select a path, just 
click the red square associated with any of the existing points.
<p>

<p>
<img src="sprites4.jpg">
</p>

Before playing the shot, there's one more adjustment to make. 
Select the first point in the animation by clicking its red
square. Then, in the top
control bar, find the labeled "Rot:" (that stands for "Rotate").
<p>
<img src="rot.jpg">
</p>
Change the value to 45.0, then click the Rot: button. The first goose
is now tilted upwards. Select the second point, and set its rotation
to 20.0.  Then click Play in the right control panel to
see how it all looks.

<p>
There are several things we can do to improve the shot. One is to change the
path so that the path begins and ends off camera. Use the +/- buttons in
the left of the top control to zoom out. Once you've zoomed out,
click and drag the background image so it's in the center of the
display. Then move the start and end points of the path so they're
both off camera. It should look like this:
<p>
<img src="sprites5.jpg">
</p>

Click Play to see if the new version is better.

<p>
A second thing to try concerns the "Frames-per-cell". Find the box
labled "FperCell" in the top control panel.

<p>
<img src="fpercell.jpg">
</p>

We're using 4 different drawings of the goose, so this is a 4-cell animation.
Currently FperCell is 4. That means: show 4 frames of the first 
drawing, then 4 frames of the second, etc.  Change FperCell to 2,
then click Play. The goose's wings will flap faster.

<p>
A final parameter of interest is the "Reps" value (it's located right
before the FperCell setting in the top control panel). "Reps" is short
for "repititions", and specifies how many times the animation should
play during the course of the shot. A Reps value of 1 means: play 
the animation once. A value of 3 means: play it 3 times. Reset the 
value to 3, then click Play. The goose will fly much faster.

<p>
Let's look now at another approach to animation. We'll animate a sprite,
then lock the camera on it, creating a tracking shot. This
shot requires 3 more images:
<p>
<img src="fence.jpg" width=250 height=125>
<img src="alice.png">
<img src="tree.png" width=131 height=187>
<p>
Right-click each of these, and save to the project directory. Then click
Add Shots in the right control panel, and select "fence.jpg" from the
Select File dialog. This image is large, so you'll need to use the +/-
zoom buttons on the left of the top control panel to bring it into view.
<p>
Next click Sprite: Add and select "tree.png" from the Select File dialog.
Move the tree to the center of the shot. Then click Sprite: Add and select
"alice.png". Place Alice in the lower right. We're going to animate Alice,
so we need to add a point on her path: find the "Pt: Add" button on the
top control panel, and click it.
<p>
<img src="ptadd.jpg">
</p>
Click/drag the center red square of the newly added point over to the left,
so the shot looks like this.

<p>
<img src="aliceani.jpg">
</p>


Click Play. Notice that Alice passes behind the tree. This is 
a problem of "Z-order". Sprites with higher Z appear in front of sprites
with lower Z. By default, all sprites (animation path points) are assigned
a Z value of 0. So to fix this shot, click the red square for the tree 
sprite, thus selecting it. Then find the "setZ:" button in the top control
panel:

<p>
<img src="setz.jpg">
</p>

Change the value to -1, then click the "setZ" button. If you click
Play, Alice will pass in front of the tree.

<p>
Now bring the camera down and to the right, resizing it so it frames
Alice.
<p>
<img src="aliceani2.jpg">
</p>
We want the camera to track Alice, so that it follows her as she walks
left. To see how this works, click on the small green square, selecting
the camera
(if you want A to track B, you first select A).
Click Track in the upper control panel, then click the small
red square in the center of the Alice sprite.
<p>
<img src="track.jpg">
</p>

<p>
Click Play and you'll see the camera follows Alice as she
moves across the background.

<p>
Try changing the Reps count for the shot to 3. Click the red square for
the first point in the sprite's animation path (clicking any point in
an animation selects it). Reset the value
in the Reps box in the top control panel to 3.
<p>
<img src="reps.jpg">
</p>

You'll find that the
camera is no longer synchronized with the sprite. To bring it back in
sync, you must also change the Rep count of the camera to 3.
Also: if you change the animation path of the sprite, you'll need
to repeat the setup for tracking.
<p>
In this example we've made the camera track a sprite. You can also
make one sprite track another. To see how this works, we'll add a
word balloon to this shot. In the right control panel, click on the
Text tab to open the text pane.
<p>
<img src="textcntrl.jpg">
</p>
Enter "I'm getting nowhere FAST!", change the font size to 16pt, then
click Apply. A text sprite will appear in the middle of the image:

<p>
<img src="text1.jpg">
</p>

Click and drag the light blue circle, moving the text over to Alice
on the right.  Then click on a balloon in the text control pane. 
The result should look like this.

<p>
<img src="text2.jpg">
</p>

A text control has 3 handles. Click/drag the square in the center to
move the text. (In the picture above, the square has turned into a 
circle to show the text has been selected). Click/drag the triangle 
in the lower right corner to
resize the balloon. Click/drag the triangle at center to move the
balloon up or down, relative to the text.

<p>
If you play the shot, you'll see that the text doesn't travel with
Alice. To make the text track Alice, click on the blue center square
to select it. Then click Track in the top control. Finally, click on
the red square in the center of the Alice sprite. This is exactly the
same procedure that we followed we made the camera track the sprite.
The sequence is: 1. click on the thing that's going to do the tracking;
2. click the Track button in the top control; 3. click on the thing
that's going to be tracked.


<h4> Faq </h4> 


<div id="whycomiola" class="entry">
<div class="entrytitle">
Why "Comiola"?
</div>
<p> 
Early movie editing machines were called "Moviolas". Hence "Comiola" -- a
Moviola for comics.

<div id="howaniworks" class="entry">
<div class="entrytitle">
How does animation work in Comiola?
</div>
<p> 
Comiola uses 2 kinds of animation: path and cell. In this shot
<p>
<img src="sprites5.jpg">
</p>
we've set up a 3 point path animation for the goose. The goose will
enter the shot bottom left, fly across the screem, and exit top right.
The sprite will be drawn smaller as the animation progresses, so it looks
like the goose is flying off into the distance. Notice that, in the first
2 points, the sprite is tilted upward: this makes it look like the goose
is flying up and away.
<p>
Cell animation is completely independant of path animation. When you add a
sprite to a shot, Comiola asks you to select the image(s) for the sprite.
In this case we selected 4 images, each showing the wings in a different
position. When the shot is played, Comiola cycles through the images,
so it looks like the bird is flapping her wings.
<p>
There's one more kind of animation we should mention: camera animation.
This is actually a kind of path animation, because Comiola lets you define
an animation path for the camera (just as you would for sprites).
In this shot
<p>
<img src="addshots7.jpg">
</p>
we've setup a 3 point animation for the camera. The small green squares
show where the camera is pointed, and the enclosing green rectangles
demark the portion of the image that will be shown on screen.
This shot starts with a closeup of the birds, then the camera 
zooms out to show more of the scene. Then the camera pans right
and stops when the face of the Queen of Night is centered. 
Camera animation can be very useful, because it lets you
turn a single panel into a dynamic shot.

<div id="imagefiletypes" class="entry">
<div class="entrytitle">
What kinds of image files can I use?
</div>
<p> 
For background images, you can use either PNG or JPG files. For sprites, 
you must use PNG files with transparent backgrounds.

<div id="howaddshot" class="entry">
<div class="entrytitle">
How do I add/delete a shot?
</div>
<p> 
Open the Shots tab in the right control panel, then click Add Shots.
<p>
<img src="addshots.jpg">
</p>
In the File Select dialog, select the image file containing your artwork.
This can be either a JPG or a PNG file.
<p>
Tip#1: If your artwork is a multi-panel comic, enable the
"split" checkbox before clicking Add Shots. This will split 
(say) a 4 panel comic into a sequence of 4 shots, 1 shot per
panel. (But it only works if the panels are seperated by straight,
empty gutters).
<p>
Tip#2: If your artwork is not multipanel, but is surrounded by
empty white space, enable the "trim" checkbox to trim the
empty margins.

<p>
A second way to add a shot is to click "Clone Shot". This
adds a copy of the current shot. You can then reset the
camera so it shows a different part of the image.

<p>
To delete a shot, click the Cut/Paste tab of the right 
control panel.

<div id="howsetcam" class="entry">
<div class="entrytitle">
How do I set/animate the camera?
</div>
<p> 
When you add a shot, Comiola takes you to the new shot.
It will look like this:
<p>
<img src="newshot.jpg">
</p>
The small green square in the center of the image shows
where the camera is pointing. The large green outline
surrounding it shows the camera view. Clicking the small
green square selects the camera for editing: it turns into a
circle to show the camera has been selected. A small green
triangle will appear on the right edge of the camera view:
click and drag on the triangle to resize the camera view.
Click and drag on the small green square to move the camera.
<p>
To animate the camera, first move/resize the camera
to setup for the start of the animation. This will be the
starting point for the animation. Then click "Pt: Add" in the top
control panel.
<p>
<img src="ptadd.jpg">
</p>
This will be the ending point for the animation: resize/move it
so it's correct for the final view in the animation.

<p>
Tip: if the second point of the camera animation is left or
right of the first point, you've created a pan. If the second
point contains the first point, you've created a zooom-out.
When you position/resize the second point, you can combine
both pan and zoom to get the effect you're after.

<div id="howsaddsprite" class="entry">
<div class="entrytitle">
How do I add/animate a sprite?
</div>
<p> 
In the Shots tab in the right panel, click Add Sprite.
<p>
<img src="addsprites.jpg">
</p>
Select one or more images from the File Open dialog box.
<p>
Comiola supports two kinds of animation: path and cell. In path
animation, the same image is used for the sprite as it moves
around on the screen (though it can shrink or grow, depending on
how you're set up the path). In cell animation, mutiple images 
are shown for the sprite: Comiola cycles through the set,
showing the first one for (say) 2 frames, advancing to the second 
for another 2 frames, etc. To get cell animation, select multiple
files from the File Open dialog box.
<p>
Image files for sprites must be PNG files, with transparent backgrounds.
<p>
In this shot:
<p>
<img src="howaddsprite.jpg">
</p>
we've added a sprite ("Alice"). To select a sprite, click on the small
red square in the center (it turns into a circle, to show that 
the sprite was selected). Click and drag to move the sprite. To resize 
the sprite, click and drag the red triangle
to the right of the square. 
<p>
To animate a sprite, move and resize it so that it's where it should
at the beginning of the animation. Make sure it's selected, then
click Pt: Add in the top control panel.
<p>
<img src="ptadd.jpg">
</p>
This adds a second point to the animation path. Move and resize it so 
it's where it should be at the end of the animation. In this shot
<p>
<img src="aliceani.jpg">
</p>
we've defined a simple 2 point path for Alice. When the shot plays,
she'll stroll across the screen. (Notice there's a second sprite in
this shot, a small tree. Since there's only one point in it's
animation path, it will stay where it is when the shot is played).

<div id="howtracking" class="entry">
<div class="entrytitle">
How do I set up a tracking shot?
</div>
<p> 
In a tracking shot, the camera follows a sprite as it moves.
So the first step is to add a sprite and define an animation
path for it. In this example
<p>
<img src="aliceani.jpg">

we created a simple 2 point animation for Alice. The first point is
at lower right, and the second point is at lower left.
<p>
The next step is to move and resize the camera so that it frames
Alice at the first point. 
<p>
<img src="aliceani2.jpg">
</p>
The last step is to actually create the tracking. Click the small green
square to select the camera. Then, in the top control panel, click Track.
<p>
<img src="track.jpg">
</p>
Finally click the small red square, thus selecting the sprite which
is to be tracked by the camera. You will see that a second point has
been added to the camera's animation path, and that this second point
frames Alice in just the way the first point did. This means that camera
will follow Alice as she moves across the screen.
<p>
If you want the camera to zoom in or out as Alice travels across
the screen, just resize the second point in the camera's animation
path.
<p>
Tip1: If you change Alice's path, you'll have to re-do the steps 
you took to set up tracking (changing Alice's path will not
automatically change the camera path).
<p>
Tip2: Tracking isn't restricted to the camera. If you want sprite A
to follow sprite B, just select sprite A, click Track on the top 
control panel, then select sprite B.

How do I place one sprite in front of another?
</div>
<p> 
You need to change the "Z-order" of the sprites.
Sprites with higher Z appear in front of sprites
with lower Z. By default, all sprites (animation path points) are assigned
a Z value of 0. Suppose you want sprite A to be in front of sprite B.
Select sprite B,
then find the "setZ:" button in the top control
panel:

<p>
<img src="setz.jpg">
</p>

Change the value to -1, then click the "setZ" button. 


<div id="howtext" class="entry">

How do I add text and word balloons to a shot?
</div>
<p> 
Click the Text tab in the right control panel to bring up
the text control.
<p>
<img src="textcntrl.jpg">
</p>

Enter some text, then click Apply. A text sprite will be added
to the shot. Click on an appropriate balloon in the control panel
to surround the text with a balloon.
<p>
<img src="text2.jpg">
</p>

A text sprite has 3 handles. Click/drag the square in the center to
move the text. (In the picture above, the square has turned into a 
circle to show the text has been selected). Click/drag the triangle 
in the lower right corner to
resize the balloon. Click/drag the triangle at center to move the
balloon up or down, relative to the text.

<p>
In the right control panel, notice that there is an empty rectangle
below the balloons.  If you specify an html-style hex color code
("#FF0000") in the box labeled "Color:", then click the rectangle,
any balloon will be replaced with a rectangular colored background.
If you leave the Color box blank, the background will be invisible
(so if you've put a balloon around the text and want to erase it,
just clear any value in the Color box and click the rectangle).

How do I set the length of a shot?
</div>
<p> 
Comiola measures shot length in "ticks". 
<p>
<img src="setticks.jpg">
</p>
A tick is a unit of time. By default, Comiola assigns each shot 
10 ticks. If you want a shot to last 1/2 as long as the default,
set its ticks to "5". If you want it to last 4 times as long, set its
ticks to "40". 
<p>
But how long is a tick in seconds? That depends! Here's
the Animation section of the right control panel.
<p>
<img src="animation.jpg">
</p>
Both of the "Play" buttons, plus Create Video, have a "secs" (short for
"seconds") field. When 
you click a play button (or create the video) Comiola will total up 
all the ticks for each shot, then adjust the milliseconds in a tick to
ensure that the duration of the animation accords with the value in
the "secs" field.


<div id="tSandtE" class="entry">
<div class="entrytitle">
How do I make an animation start/end partway through a shot?
</div>
<p> 
You need to adjust the "time-Start" and "time-End" values for the
animation. First click any point of the animation to select the
animation. Then find the "tS" and "tE" boxes in the top control
panel.
<p>
<img src="tStE.jpg">
</p>
"tS = 0.0" means: start the animation at the start of the shot.
If we wanted the animation to start when 1/4 of the time
allocated to the shot has passed, we'd set this value to ".25".
<p>
"tE = 1.0" means: complete the animation when the shot ends. To 
make the animation end before the shot ends, change tE
to (say) ".75". That means: time the animation so that it's complete,
3/4 thru the time allocated to the shot. 

<div id="reps" class="entry">
<div class="entrytitle">
	How do I make an animation repeat itself (loop)?
</div>
<p> 
Suppose you want to make an animation repeat itself 3 times. There
are two ways to do this one. One is to simply add 2 clones of
the shot.
<p>
<img src="cloneshot.jpg">
</p>
<p>
Another way is to adjust the "repetitions" value for the animation.
First click any point in the animation path, to select it.
Then find the "Reps" box in the top control panel.
<p>
<img src="reps.jpg">
</p>
<p>
A Reps value of 1 means: play 
the animation once. A value of 3 means: play it 3 times. 
Note that this will make the animation play three times as fast.
So you may want to extend the length of the shot: see
