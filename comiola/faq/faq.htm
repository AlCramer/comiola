Comiola Tutorial: Shots and Camera
</div>

<p>
Let's start by making a very simple 4-shot movie. First, create an empty 
folder for your project. Then right-click on the image below and save it in
the folder. The file name is "queenofnight.jpg".
<p>
<img src="queenofnight.jpg" width="270" height="248">
</p>

To create the new project, click the File button in the upper left corner
of the editor. The file drop pane will appear.
<p>
<img src="filedropdown.jpg">
</p>
Enter a name for your project ("MyProject"), then click New. The Select Folder
dialog appears: select the folder you created earlier. Comiola will create 
a new (empty) project. The display next to the file button changes to
<p>
<img src="projdir.jpg">
</p>
The project file is named "MyProject.cprj" 
(all project files end with ".cprj").
To reopen this project after you've exited Comiloa, 
click File/Open and select that file from the File open dialog.
<p>
To add the first shot, click the "Add Shots" button in the editor control 
panel.
<p>
<img src="addshots.jpg">
</p>
In the File Select dialog, go to the project directory and select 
"queenofnight.jpg". The editor displays the first shot. Notice there's
a small green square in the center, and a green triangle off to the right.
These represent the camera. Click and drag the triangle towards the square,
reducing the size of the enclosing green rectangle -- 
we're bringing the camera in for a closeup.
Click on the green square (it turns into a circle to show the camera
has been selected), and drag the camera so it's centered on the
sphinx. Fiddle with the camera controls until you get something like this:
<p>
<img src="addshots1.jpg">
</p>

What's this shot actually look like? Here's another look at the control 
panel of the editor. 
<p>
<img src="addshots2.jpg">
</p>
             
Click the "Play this Shot" button. You'll see a 2-second shot of the
sphinx. Not very interesting, so let's add a second shot.
In the editor control panel, click the "Clone Shot" button: 
<p>
<img src="addshots3.jpg">
</p>

We're now on the second. Move and resize the camera so it looks like
this.

<p>
<img src="addshots4.jpg">
</p>

Click the Clone Shot button again, and move the camera down to the birds:

<p>
<img src="addshots5.jpg">
</p>

So far we've created a 3-shot sequence. To see what it looks like,
click the Play All button.
<p>
<img src="playall.jpg">
</p>

These shots are all static. Let's make a 
shot which animates the camera. First click the Clone Shot button,
taking us to the next shot. Click the center green square
of the camera: it turns into a circle, indicating its selected.
On the top control bar, click the "Pt: Add" button. 
<p>
<img src="ptadd.jpg">
</p>

<p>
This adds a second point to the camera path, creating an animation. 
Use the move/resize handles of the second point so that the camera 
boxes look something like this:
<p>
<p>
<img src="addshots6.jpg">
</p>

<p>
The second camera surrounds the first, so this will be zoom-out.
Click Play This Shot to see the effect.
<p>
Let's turn the shot into a zoom-out followed by a pan. Click the
Pt: Add button to add a third point to the animation path, then
use the move/resize handles of the third camera so the whole thing
looks like this.
<p>
<img src="addshots7.jpg">
</p>
Click Play this Shot to see how the zoom+pans works. It
might work better if the camera lingered a bit at the
end of the shot, so the viewer can look a bit longer at the
queen's face. In the top control bar, find the boxes labled 
"tS" and "tE" (these mean "time-Start" and "time-End".
Click on any point in the camera animation to
select that animation's path, and note that tS is "0.0" and 
tE is "1.0". 
<p>
<img src="tStE.jpg">
</p>
"tS = 0.0" means: start the animation at the start of the shot.
If we wanted the animation to start when 1/4 of the time
allocated to the shot has passed, we'd set this value to ".25".
In this case we want the animation to start when the shot begins,
so we'll leave tS at 0.0
<p>
"tE = 1.0" means: complete the animation when the shot ends. To 
make the camera linger a bit at the end of the shot, change tE
to ".75". That means: time the animation so that it's complete,
3/4 thru the time allocated to the shot. That will give the effect 
we're after. So change tS to ".75", click Play The Check, and verify
that it all works the way it's supposed to.
<p>
To see what we've accomplished so far, click the Play All button 
in the right cntroll panel. The results are promising but the
rythymn of the shots seems wrong: it would be better if the first
three shot were short and quick, and the animated shot were a
lot longer. To fix this, make sure you're on the 4th shot,
and find the Set Ticks button in the right control panel.
<p>
<img src="setticks.jpg">
</p>
A tick is a unit of time. By default, Comiola assigns each shot 
10 ticks. If you want a shot to last 1/2 as long as the default,
set its ticks to "5". If you want it to last 4 times as long, set its
ticks to "40". 
<p>
But how long is a tick in seconds? That depends! Have a closer look
at the Animation section of the right control panel.
<p>
<img src="animation.jpg">
</p>
All of the "Play" buttons, plus Create Video, have a "secs" (short for
"seconds") field. When 
you click a play button (or create the video) Comiola will total up 
all the ticks for each shot, then adjust the milliseconds in a tick to
ensure that the duration of the animation accords with the value in
the "secs" field.
<p>
Timing in animation is everything! The best way to get a feel for it is to
play with the settings. If you want to make a shot shorter, assign it 
less ticks. If you want to make it longer, give it more ticks. Then 
experiment with the "secs" values to see how the whole piece flows.
<p> 
To wrap up this tutorial, click Create Video in the right control
panel. 

<p>
<img src="createvideo.jpg">
</p>
If your project is named "MyProject", this will create the file
"MyProject.mp4" in the project directory.

Comiola Tutorial: Animating Sprites
</div>

This tutorial uses 4 new images:
<p>
<img src="goose1.png">
<img src="goose2.png">
<img src="goose3.png">
<img src="goose4.png">
<p>
Right-click each of them, and save them to your project directory. Re-open
your project, navigate to the last shot, and click Add Shots. Select 
queenofnight.jpg in the File Select dialog. Leave the camera as is 
(centered and as wide as possible). Click Sprites: Add in the right
control panel:
<p>
<img src="addsprites.jpg">
</p>

and select all four of the goose images in the File Select 
Dialog. This will add a goose to the shot:
<p>
<img src="sprites1.jpg">
</p>

To move a sprite, click and drag the red square in the center.
To resize it, click and drag the red triangle. Use these controls
to move the goose down to the lower left corner of the shot,
and make it bigger. It should look something like this:
<p>
<img src="sprites2.jpg">
</p>
We're going to make the goose fly up and out of the shot, using a
3 point animation path. So far we've got the first point. Add the second
point by clicking Pt: Add on the top control bar.
<p>
<img src="ptadd.jpg">
</p>
Click it again to add the third point. Then move and resize the new
points so the shot looks something like this:
<p>
<img src="sprites3.jpg">
</p>

<p>
Tip: to add a point to a path, the path must first have been selected
(otherwise the Pt: Add button is inactive). To select a path, just 
click the red square associated with any of the existing points.
<p>

After moving and resizing the points, the shot should look like this.
<p>
<img src="sprites4.jpg">
</p>

Before playing the shot, there's one more adjustment to make. 
Select the first point in the animation by clicking its red
square. Then, in the top
control bar, find the labeled "Rot:" (that stands for "Rotate").
<p>
<img src="rot.jpg">
</p>
Change the value to 45.0, then click the Rot: button. The first goose
is now tilted upwards. Select the second point, and set its rotation
to 20.0.  Then click Play This Shot in the right control panel to
see how it all looks.

<p>
There are several things we can do to improve the shot. One is to change the
path so that the path begins and ends off camera. Use the +/- buttons in
the left of the top control to zoom out. Once you've zoomed out,
click and drag the background image so it's in the center of the
display. Then move the start and end points of the path so they're
both off camera. It should look like this:
<p>
<img src="sprites5.jpg">
</p>

Click Play This Shot to see if the new version is better.

<p>
A second thing to try concerns the "Frames-per-cell". Find the box
labled "FperCell" in the top control panel.

<p>
<img src="fpercell.jpg">
</p>

We're using 4 different drawings of the goose, so this is a 4-cell animation.
Currently FperCell is 4. That means: show 4 frames of the first 
drawing, then 4 frames of the second, etc.  Change FperCell to 2,
then click Play This Shot. The goose's wings will flap faster.

<p>
A final parameter of interest is the "Reps" value (it's located right
before the FperCell setting in the top control panel). "Reps" is short
for "repititions", and specifies how many times the animation should
play during the course of the shot. A Reps value of 1 means: play 
the animation once. A value of 3 means: play it 3 times. Reset the 
value to 3, then click Play This Shot. The goose will fly much faster.

<p>
Let's look now at another approach to animation. We'll animate a sprite,
then lock the camera on it, creating a tracking shot. This
shot requires 3 more images:
<p>
<img src="fence.jpg" width=250 height=125>
<img src="alice.png">
<img src="tree.png" width=131 height=187>
<p>
Right-click each of these, and save to the project directory. Then click
Add Shots in the right control panel, and select "fence.jpg" from the
Select File dialog. This image is large, so you'll need to use the +/-
zoom buttons on the left of the top control panel to bring it into view.
<p>
Next click Sprite: Add and select "tree.png" from the Select File dialog.
Move the tree to the center of the shot. Then click Sprite: Add and select
"alice.png". Place Alice in the lower right. We're going to animate Alice,
so we need to add a point on her path: find the "Pt: Add" button on the
top control panel, and click it.
<p>
<img src="ptadd.jpg">
</p>
Click/drag the center red square of the newly added point over to the left,
so the shot looks like this.

<p>
<img src="aliceani.jpg">
</p>


Click Play This Shot. Notice that Alice passes behind the tree. This is 
a problem of "Z-order". Sprites with higher Z appear in front of sprites
with lower Z. By default, all sprites (animation path points) are assigned
a Z value of 0. So to fix this shot, click the red square for the tree 
sprite, thus selecting it. Then find the "setZ:" button in the top control
panel:

<p>
<img src="setz.jpg">
</p>

Change the value to -1, then click the "setZ" button. If you click
Play This Shot, Alice will pass in front of the tree.

<p>
Now bring the camera down and to the right, resizing it so it frames
Alice.
<p>
<img src="aliceani2.jpg">
</p>

Then click Lock Cam in the upper control panel.
<p>
<img src="lockcam.jpg">
</p>

<p>
Click Play This Shot and you'll see the camera follows Alice as she
moves across the background.

<p>
Try changing the Reps count for the shot to 3. Click the red square for
the first point in the sprite's animation path, then change the value
in the Reps box in the top control panel:
<p>
<img src="reps.jpg">
</p>

You'll find that the
camera is no longer synchronized with the sprite. To bring it back in
sync, you must also change the Rep count of the camera to 3.
Also: if you change the animation path of the sprite, you'll need
to click Lock Cam to re-sync the camera with the sprite.
